  /*
  Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of
  the longest peak in the array.

  A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly
  increasing until they reach a tip (the highest value in the peak), at which
  point they become strictly decreasing. At least three integers are required to
  form a peak.

  For example, the integers [1, 4, 10, 2] form a peak, but the
  integers [4, 0, 10] don't and neither do the integers [1, 2, 2, 0]. Similarly, the integers
  [1, 2, 3]  don't form a peak because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the 3.
