## [Youngest Common Ancestor]()

#### Level: Medium ðŸ“˜

> You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an `AncestralTree` class that have an `ancestor` property pointing to their youngest ancestor. The first input is the top ancestor in an ancestral tree (i.e., the only instance that has no ancestor--its `ancestor` property points to `None` / `null`), and the other two inputs are descendants in the ancestral tree.
>
> Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two descendants.
>
> Note that a descendant is considered its own ancestor. So in the simple ancestral tree below, the youngest common ancestor to nodes A and B is node A.

```python
# This is an input class. Do not edit.
class AncestralTree:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.ancestor = None


def getYoungestCommonAncestor(topAncestor, descendantOne, descendantTwo):
  depthOne = getDescendantDepth(descendantOne, topAncestor)
	depthTwo = getDescendantDepth(descendantTwo, topAncestor)
	if depthOne > depthTwo:
		return backtrackAncestralTree(descendantOne, descendantTwo, depthOne - depthTwo)
	return backtrackAncestralTree(descendantTwo, descendantOne, depthTwo - depthOne)

def getDescendantDepth(descendant, topAncestor):
	depth = 0
	while descendant != topAncestor:
		depth += 1
		descendant = descendant.ancestor
	return depth

def backtrackAncestralTree(lowerDescendant, higherDescendant, diff):
	while diff > 0:
		diff -= 1
		lowerDescendant = lowerDescendant.ancestor
	while lowerDescendant != higherDescendant:
		lowerDescendant = lowerDescendant.ancestor
		higherDescendant = higherDescendant.ancestor
	return lowerDescendant
```

### O(d) time | O(1) space - d means depth/ height of ancestral tree
