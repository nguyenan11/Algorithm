## [Leetcode #115 - Distinct Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/)

#### Level: Hard ðŸ“•

```python
def numDistinct(self, S, T):
  row = len(S) + 1
  col = len(T) + 1
  dp = [0]*col
  dp[0] = 1
  for i in range(1, row):
    diag = 1
    for j in range(1, col):
      tmp = dp[j]
      if S[i-1] == T[j-1]:
        dp[j] = diag + dp[j]
      diag = tmp
  return dp[-1]
```

### O(nm) time | O(m) space - n is length of string S, m is length of string T
