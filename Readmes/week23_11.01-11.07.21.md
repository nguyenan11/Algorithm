## [Leetcode #236 - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

#### Level: Medium ðŸ“˜

```python
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
  """
  :type root: TreeNode
  :type p: TreeNode
  :type q: TreeNode
  :rtype: TreeNode
  """
  if not root:
    return
  if root == p or root == q:
    return root

  left = right = None
  left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
  right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

  if left and right:
    return root
  else:
    return left or right
```
