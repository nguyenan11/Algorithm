# Recursion

## [Leetcode #70 - Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
* *Python*

#### Level: Easy ðŸ“—

```python
def climbStairs(n):
    '''
    Function -- climbStairs
        Finds total number of distinct ways to climb to the top, given each 
        time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
    Parameter:
        n - number of stairs to reach a top, an int.
    Return:
        An int represents total number of distinct ways to climb the stairs.
    '''
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2)
```

### O(n) time | O(n) space
* Could make this O(1) space using Fibonacci Number approach

# Linked List

## [Leetcode #2 - Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
* *Python*

```python
def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
    '''
    Function -- addTwoNumbers
        Given 2 non-empty Linked Lists, each represents an int in reverse order 
        (for ex, [1, 2, 3] means number 321). Calculates the sum of those 2 
        numbers and return the result in format of Linked List.
        Ex: [1, 2, 3] + [1, 2, 2, 3]  = [2, 4, 5, 3]
        Because 321 + 3221 = 3542
    Parameter:
        l1 - 1st Linked List of digits (integers)
        l2 - 2nd Linked List of digits (integers)
    Return:
        A Linked List of digits, which represents an int in reverse order.
    '''
    needAddOne = 0
    root = n = ListNode(0)
    while l1 or l2 or needAddOne:
        val1 = val2 = 0
        if l1:
            val1 = l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2:
            val2 = l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        needAddOne, val = divmod(val1+val2+needAddOne, 10)
        n.next = ListNode(val)
        n = n.next
    return root.next
```

### O(max(m, n)) time | O(max(m, n)) space - where m is length of linked list 1 and n is length of linked list 2

## [Remove Duplicates From Linked List](../LinkedList/src/main/java/RemoveDuplicateFromLL.java)

#### Level: Easy ðŸ“—

> You're given the head of a Singly Linked List whose nodes are in sorted order with respect to their values. Write a function that returns a modified version of the Linked List that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values. The Linked List should be modified in place (i.e., you shouldn't create a brand new list), and the modified Linked List should still have its nodes sorted with respect to their values.
>
> Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or to `None` / `null` if it's the tail of the list.

```java
public static class LinkedList {
  public int value;
  public LinkedList next;

  public LinkedList(int value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

public LinkedList removeDuplicatesFromLinkedList(LinkedList linkedList) {
  LinkedList currNode = linkedList;
  while (currNode != null) {
    LinkedList nextNode = currNode.next;
    while (nextNode != null && nextNode.value == currNode.value) {
      nextNode = nextNode.next;
    }

    currNode.next = nextNode;
    currNode = nextNode;
  }
  return linkedList;
}
```

# Strings

## [Leetcode #3 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
* Redo problem using Python

#### Level: Medium ðŸ“˜

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
    '''
    Function -- lengthOfLongestSubstring
        Finds the longest substring without repeating character.
    Parameter:
        s - input String
    Return:
        Longest substring without repeating. 
        Assumption: There's only 1 longest substring.
    '''
    lastSeen = {}
    startIdx, longest = 0, 0
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in lastSeen:
            startIdx = max(startIdx, lastSeen[char] + 1)
        longest = max(longest, idx + 1 - startIdx)
        lastSeen[char] = idx
    return longest
```

### O(n) time | O(min(n, a)) - n is the length of input string and a is the length of the character alphabet represented in the input string

# Array

## [Leetcode #1004 - Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

#### Level: Medium ðŸ“˜

```python
def longestOnes(self, nums, k):
    '''
    Function -- longestOnes
        Finds the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can 
        flip at most k 0's.
    Parameter:
        nums - binary array of integers (1 and 0 only)
        k - maximum number (an int) of 0's can be flipped into 1's
    Return:

            i += 1
    return j - i + 1

### O(n) time | O(1) space - n is the number of elements in nums array
