## [Lowest Common Manager](../Recursion/src/main/java/LowestCommonManager.java)

#### Level: Hard ðŸ“•

> You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an `OrgChart` class that have a `directReports` property pointing to their direct reports. The first input is the top manager in an organizational chart (i.e., the only instance that isn't anybody else's direct report), and the other two inputs are reports in the organizational chart. The two reports are guaranteed to be distinct.
> Write a function that returns the lowest common manager to the two reports.

```java
public static OrgChart getLowestCommonManager(
    OrgChart topManager, OrgChart reportOne, OrgChart reportTwo) {
  return getOrgInfo(topManager, reportOne, reportTwo).lowestCommonManager;
}

public static OrgInfo getOrgInfo(OrgChart manager, OrgChart reportOne, OrgChart reportTwo) {
  int numImportantReports = 0;
  for (OrgChart directReport : manager.directReports) {
    OrgInfo orgInfo = getOrgInfo(directReport, reportOne, reportTwo);
    if (orgInfo.lowestCommonManager != null) return orgInfo;
    numImportantReports += orgInfo.numImportantReports;
  }
  if (manager == reportOne || manager == reportTwo) numImportantReports++;
  OrgChart lowestCommonManager = numImportantReports == 2 ? manager : null;
  OrgInfo newOrgInfo = new OrgInfo(lowestCommonManager, numImportantReports);
  return newOrgInfo;
}

// source code
static class OrgChart {
  public char name;
  public List<OrgChart> directReports;

  OrgChart(char name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.directReports = new ArrayList<OrgChart>();
  }

  // This method is for testing only.
  public void addDirectReports(OrgChart[] directReports) {
    for (OrgChart directReport : directReports) {
      this.directReports.add(directReport);
    }
  }
}

// helper class
static class OrgInfo {
  public OrgChart lowestCommonManager;
  int numImportantReports;
  
  OrgInfo(OrgChart lowestCommonManager, int numImportantReports) {
    this.lowestCommonManager = lowestCommonManager;
    this.numImportantReports = numImportantReports;
  }
}
```

### O(n) time | O(d) space - n is number of people, d is the depth (height) of orgChart

## [Leetcode #231 - Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)
* Python

#### Level: Easy ðŸ“—

```python
def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
  if n == 0:
    return False
  if n == 1:
    return True
  return n % 2 == 0 and self.isPowerOfTwo(n // 2)
```

### O(log n) time | O(log n) space
