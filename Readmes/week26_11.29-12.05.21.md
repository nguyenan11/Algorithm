# Recursion

## [Nth Fibonacci](../Recursion/src/main/java/NthFibonacci.java)

#### Level: Easy ðŸ“—

> The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is `0`, the second number is `1`, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
>
> Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as `F0 = 0` and `F1 = 1`. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is `F0`; therefore, `getNthFib(1)` is equal to `F0`, `getNthFib(2)` is equal to `F1`, etc..

```java
public static int getNthFib(int n) {
  int[] lastTwo = {0, 1};
  int counter = 3;
  while (counter <= n) {
    int nextFib = lastTwo[0] + lastTwo[1];
    lastTwo[0] = lastTwo[1];
    lastTwo[1] = nextFib;
    counter++;
  }
  return n > 1 ? lastTwo[1] : lastTwo[0]; // handle edge case where n == 1
}
```

### O(n) time | O(1) space

## [Product Sum](../Recursion/src/main/java/ProductSum.java)

#### Level: Easy ðŸ“—

> Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum.
> A "special" array is a non-empty array that contains either integers or other "special" arrays. The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its elements, where "special" arrays inside it are summed themselves and then multiplied by their level of depth.
> The depth of a "special" array is how far nested it is. For instance, the depth of `[]` is `1`; the depth of the inner array in `[[]]` is `2`; the depth of the innermost array in `[[[]]]` is `3`.
> Therefore, the product sum of `[x, y]` is `x + y`; the product sum of `[x, [y, z]]` is `x + 2 * (y + z)`; the product sum of `[x, [y, [z]]]` is `x + 2 * (y + 3z)`.

```java
public static int productSum(List<Object> array) {
  return productSumRecursion(array, 1);
}

public static int productSumRecursion(List<Object> array, int multiplier) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (Object element : array) {
    if (element instanceof ArrayList) { // check if an element is a list
      @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
      ArrayList<Object> innerList = (ArrayList<Object>) element;
      sum += productSumRecursion(innerList, multiplier + 1);
    } else {
      sum += (int) element;
    }
  }
  return sum * multiplier;
}
```

### O(n) time | O(d) space - where n is the total number of elements in the array, including sub-elements, and d is the greatest depth of "special" arrays in the array

# Dynamic Programming

## [Leetcode #139 - Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)

#### Level: Medium ðŸ“˜

```python
def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
  # Bottom up approach
  dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1) # +1 for base case
  dp[len(s)] = True # base case
  
  for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
    for word in wordDict:
      if (i + len(word)) <= len(s) and s[i : i + len(word)] == word:
        dp[i] = dp[i + len(word)]
      if dp[i]:
        break
              
  return dp[0]
```
