## [Nth Fibonacci](../Recursion/src/main/java/NthFibonacci.java)

#### Level: Easy ðŸ“—

> The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is `0`, the second number is `1`, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
>
> Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as `F0 = 0` and `F1 = 1`. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is `F0`; therefore, `getNthFib(1)` is equal to `F0`, `getNthFib(2)` is equal to `F1`, etc..

```java
public static int getNthFib(int n) {
  Map<Integer, Integer> memory = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
  memory.put(1, 0);
  memory.put(2, 1);
  return getNthFib(n, memory);
}

public static int getNthFib(int n, Map<Integer, Integer> memory) {
  if (memory.containsKey(n)) {
    return memory.get(n);
  }
  memory.put(n, getNthFib(n - 1, memory) + getNthFib(n - 2, memory));
  return memory.get(n);
}
```
