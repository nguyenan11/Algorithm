## [Leetcode #703 - Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/)

#### Level: Easy ðŸ“—

> Failed attempt - but right logic
> Failed b/c self.heap might be initialized empty

```python
import heapq

class KthLargest(object):

  def __init__(self, k, nums):
    """
    :type k: int
    :type nums: List[int]
    """
    self.heap = []
    for num in nums:
      if len(self.heap) == k:
        heapq.heappushpop(self.heap, num)
      else:
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, num)
      

  def add(self, val):
    """
    :type val: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    heapq.heappushpop(self.heap, val)
    return self.heap[0]
```

> Success

```python
import heapq

class KthLargest(object):

  def __init__(self, k, nums):
    """
    :type k: int
    :type nums: List[int]
    """
    self.minHeap, self.k = nums, k
    heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
    while len(self.minHeap) > k:
      heapq.heappop(self.minHeap) # pop smallest element        

  def add(self, val):
    """
    :type val: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
    while len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
      heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
    return self.minHeap[0]
```

#### O(log n) time | O(n) - n is total number of elements in nums (because of the heap initialization based on nums, even though heap is reduced to k size later)

> heappush(), heappop(), and heappushpop() from Python has O(log n) time complexity
