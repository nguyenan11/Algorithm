# Dynamic Programming

## [Longest Common Subsequence](Dynamic%20Programming/src/main/java/LongestCommonSubsequence.java)

#### Level: Hard ðŸ“•

```java
need to fill in
```

### Complexity???

## [Leetcode #1143 - Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)
* *Python*
* Same problem as above, but instead return the whole sequence, this problem only asks to return the size of the sequence -> Help reducing space complexity

#### Level: Medium ðŸ“˜

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1, text2):
    """
    :type text1: str
    :type text2: str
    :rtype: int
    """
    m = len(text1)
    n = len(text2)
    
    if (m < n):
        return self.longestCommonSubsequence(text2, text1)
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for char in text1:
        prevRow, prevRowPrevCol = 0, 0
        for  j, d in enumerate(text2):
            prevRow, prevRowPrevCol = dp[j + 1], prevRow
            dp[j + 1] = prevRowPrevCol + 1 if char == d else max(dp[j], prevRow)
    return dp[-1]
```

### Complexity??

## [Leetcode #121 - Best Time To Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
* *Python*

#### Level: Easy ðŸ“—

```python
def maxProfit(self, prices):
    """
    :type prices: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    """
    max_profit, min_price = 0, float('inf')
    for price in prices:
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        profit = price - min_price
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
    return max_profit
```

### O(n) time
